Here's how to use this script:

Open the Google Apps Script editor in your Google Drive.
Clear any existing code and paste the code snippet provided above.
Replace the "SOURCE_FOLDER_ID" placeholder with the ID of the source folder you want to copy. You can find the folder ID in the URL when you open the folder in Google Drive.
Modify the destinationFolderName variable to the desired name for the destination folder.
Save the script.
Click the "Run" button or press Ctrl + Enter (or Cmd + Enter on macOS) to execute the copyFolderAndContents function.
The script will create a new folder in Google Drive with the specified name (destinationFolderName) and copy the source folder and its contents, including all subfolders, into the destination folder.

Please note that this script will create copies of the files and folders, so any changes made to the copied files/folders will not be reflected in the original ones.
